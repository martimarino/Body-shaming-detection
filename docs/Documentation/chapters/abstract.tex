	Social media offer great communication opportunities that sometimes can be used in an inappropriate way. One of the widely common misuses of them is cyberbullying and in particular body shaming. Twitter enables millions of active users to send and read concise messages (a maximum of 280 characters) on the Internet every day so, it is a good platform to extract and analyze data. This work shows the data mining process that leads to the building of a machine learning model that is able to detect body shaming on Twitter. Later, the presence of  concept drift was verified thanks to an online monitoring phase and an adequate solution to this problem was evaluated by testing several solutions.
