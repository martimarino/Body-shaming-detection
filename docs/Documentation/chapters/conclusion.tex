\subsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the work described in this documentation has provided satisfying results and a valid model for the body shaming detection. 
Moreover, an application for this purpose, for the real time body shaming detection, has been developed in order to let a user, more specifically a twitter moderator, detect users doing body shaming. 

Surely, the model could be updated and the best approach to cope with concept drift may be re-evaluated, in order to maintain good performances.
